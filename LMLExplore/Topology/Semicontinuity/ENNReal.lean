# Lower semicontinuity of functions to `ℝ≥0∞`

Multiplication by a finite constant `c : ℝ≥0∞` is continuous and monotone, so it preserves lower
semicontinuity of functions to `ℝ≥0∞`. Rescaling a rate function of a large deviation principle
by a positive weight uses this.

## Main statements

* `LowerSemicontinuous.ennreal_const_mul`: if `f` is lower semicontinuous and `c ≠ ∞`, then
  `y ↦ c * f y` is lower semicontinuous.
