# Laws of functions of the coordinatewise images under a product measure, and restricted factors

Under the product measure `Measure.pi μ`, the law of a function `f` of the coordinatewise images
`X i (y i)` is the law of `f` under the product of the laws of the `X i`. For example, the law of
the empirical mean of a statistic `X` of independent samples of `P` is the law of the empirical
mean of independent samples of the law of `X`.

Restricting every factor of a product of copies of `μ` to a set `B` of finite positive measure
gives the product of the conditional measures `μ[|B]`, scaled by `μ(B)` to the number of factors.

## Main statements

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_pi_comp_eq_map_pi_map`:
  `(Measure.pi μ).map (fun y ↦ f fun i ↦ X i (y i)) = (Measure.pi fun i ↦ (μ i).map (X i)).map f`.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.pi_restrict_eq_pow_smul_pi_cond`:
  `Measure.pi (fun _ ↦ μ.restrict B) = μ B ^ card ι • Measure.pi (fun _ ↦ μ[|B])`.
